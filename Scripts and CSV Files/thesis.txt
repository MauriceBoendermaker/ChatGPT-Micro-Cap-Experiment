Given the constraints and the absence of available tickers to choose from, no new investments are proposed at this time. The portfolio will continue to monitor the market for opportunities within the clean energy and biotech sectors, focusing on U.S.-listed micro-cap stocks under $300M that meet the specified criteria. The current holding in ABEO aligns with the strategy, and the portfolio remains well-positioned with significant cash reserves to capitalize on future opportunities.
